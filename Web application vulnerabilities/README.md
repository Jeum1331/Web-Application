## Web Application Vulnerability Testing and Mitigation
This project focuses on identifying and analyzing common web application vulnerabilities through hands-on testing techniques and tools. The goal is to demonstrate the exploitation of these vulnerabilities and provide actionable mitigation strategies to enhance application security.

# Key Features
Command Injection Testing: Explored and exploited command injection vulnerabilities to understand their impact on application and server security.
Brute Force Attacks: Utilized Burp Suite to perform brute force attacks, showcasing how weak authentication mechanisms can be compromised.
Client-Side Exploitation: Leveraged BeEF (Browser Exploitation Framework) to highlight vulnerabilities in client-side security and user session management.
Mitigation Strategies: Provided detailed remediation techniques for each identified vulnerability, focusing on best practices, secure coding, and configuration adjustments.
# Tools Used
Burp Suite: For intercepting, analyzing, and attacking web traffic.
BeEF: To exploit client-side vulnerabilities and demonstrate real-world attack vectors.
# Purpose
This repository is intended for educational purposes, to help developers, security professionals, and students understand the risks associated with web application vulnerabilities and the steps required to mitigate them effectively.
