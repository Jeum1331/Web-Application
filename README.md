# Web-Application

In this project, I established a resource group in Microsoft Azure and developed a secure web app to host a cybersecurity blog. By focusing on building, securing, and protecting the cloud application, I demonstrated my expertise in cloud computing, cloud security, networking, web development, cryptography, and network security. This project underscores my ability to integrate and apply these critical skills in a practical, real-world scenario.

Created a diagram illustrating the architecture of my cloud-based environment for the web application

Ran different tests for web vulnerabilities in order to understand the impact it could have on a organization if Replicants were targeted.
